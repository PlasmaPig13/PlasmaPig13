### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an avid mathematician and programmer with ADHD and as such the majority of my projects are unfinished and confusing.
This profile will likely be a clump of all the programs if ever made, unfinished or otherwise. (Some of my programs were lost to the void before I made this account so naturally they won't be here)

I'm currently working on a program for exploring Multi-point Strange Attractors. 

I'm trying to (and failing to remember to) learn C++ purely because it's faster than python, my usual language.

How to reach me: 
- Email: plasmapig13@gmail.com

Pronouns: He/Him
